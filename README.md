## About
The Greek capacity expansion model (CEM), Open Source energy MOdelling SYStem for GReece (OSeMOSYS-GR), assesses the capacity requirements of a wide range of electricity generation and storage technologies to identify the most cost-effective and sustainable electricity mix in the Greek power sector. Additionally, it evaluates the environmental impact of different electricity production methods, helping to determine optimal strategies for reducing emissions. 
In the OSeMOSYS-GR reference energy system (Fig. 1), the electricity supply system is represented by importing and extraction technologies, fossil-fired power plants using lignite, natural gas, and oil (planned investments in fossil-fired power plants are modelled exogenously), renewable energy technologies (i.e., hydro, wind onshore and offshore, solar photovoltaics, biomass, geothermal), battery energy storage systems and pumped hydro storage, hydrogen production and consumption (namely electrolysers and fuel cells), transmission, and distribution systems, as well as interconnections with neighbouring countries. The total number of technologies is 68. Each technology receives as an input and has as an output a commodity (such as natural gas, electricity, hydrogen, etc.). The total number of commodities is 15.
